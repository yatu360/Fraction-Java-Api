# Coursework Two - Full-time

Java provides several types of numbers, but it does not provide fractions. Your task is to implement a 
`Fraction` API (**A**pplication **P**rogrammer's **I**nterface) and write a small program that uses it.


## Purpose of this assignment

* To give you practice with creating classes.
* To give you practice reading the API.
* To give you more practice with string manipulation.
* To give you practice creating `Javadoc` files.

## General idea of the assignment

* Implement a `Fraction` API. 
* Write very thorough `JUnit` tests. 

Create a package named `fraction`. Your classes, `Fraction`, and `FractionTest`, 
will all be within this package.

Declare your class as 
```java
  public class Fraction implements Comparable<Fraction> {...}
``` 
(The reason for the "`implements`" part will be explained in class; for now, just do it.)

Note: The `Fraction` class has a lot of methods, but they are all pretty short. 

## The API

The following lists some information about your new `Fraction` type:

### Instance variables

Two `private` integers, known as the *numerator* and the *denominator*. 
Do not provide getters or setters for 
these instance variables; there is no reason for anything outside the `Fraction` class to know about them.

Note: Even though these instance variables are `private`, they are private to the *class*, 
not to the object. 
This means: Any `Fraction` object can access the private variables of any other `Fraction` object; it's only 
outside this class that you cannot access them.

### How written

`n/d`, where `n` is the numerator and `d` is the denominator.

### Restrictions

The denominator may not be zero.

### Normalisation

* The fraction is **always** kept in the lowest terms, that is, the *Greatest Common Divisor* (GCD) 
of `n` and `d` is `1` (use Euclid's algorithm).

* The denominator is never negative. (You can give a negative number for the denominator 
to the constructor when you create the fraction, but a negative fraction should be represented internally 
with a negative numerator.)

* Zero should be represented as `0/1`.

The following lists the constructors you should have:

Constructor | How it uses its parameters
------------|------------
`public Fraction(int numerator, int denominator)` | Parameters are the *numerator* and the *denominator*. **Normalize** the fraction as you create it. For instance, if the parameters are `(8, -12)`, create a `Fraction` with numerator `-2` and denominator `3`. The constructor should throw an `ArithmeticException` if the denominator is zero.
`public Fraction(int wholeNumber)` | The parameter is the numerator and `1` is the implicit denominator.
`public Fraction(String fraction)` | The parameter is a `String` containing either a whole number, such as `"5"` or `"-3"`, or a fraction, such as `"8/-12"`. Allow blanks around (but not within) integers. The constructor should throw an `ArithmeticException` if given a string representing a fraction whose denominator is zero.<br/><br/>You may find it helpful to look at the available [`String`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/lang/String.html) methods in the [Java API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/overview-summary.html).

Notes:

* Java allows you to have more than one constructor, so long as they have different numbers or 
  types of parameters. For example, if you call `new Fraction(3)` you will get the second constructor 
  listed above. A `String` is a string, though, so the third constructor will have to distinguish 
  between `"3"` and `"3/4"`.
* To throw an `Exception`, write a statement such as:

  ```java
  throw new ArithmeticException("Divide by zero"); 
  ```
  (The `String` parameter is optional.)
* The java method `Integer(string).parseInt()` will return the `int` equivalent of the string 
  (assuming that the string represents a legal integer).
  Malformed input will cause it to throw a `NumberFormatException`.
  
Method signature | What it does
-----------------|------------
`public Fraction add(Fraction f)` | Returns a new `Fraction` that is the **sum** of `this` and `that`: <br/><br/>`a/b + c/d` is `(ad + bc)/bd`
`public Fraction subtract(Fraction f)` | Returns a new `Fraction` that is the **difference** of `this` minus `that`: <br/><br/> `a/b - c/d` is `(ad - bc)/bd`
`public Fraction multiply(Fraction f)` | Returns a new `Fraction` that is the **product** of `this` and `that`:<br/><br/> `(a/b) * (c/d)` is `(a*c)/(b*d)`
`public Fraction divide(Fraction f)` | Returns a new `Fraction` that is the **quotient** of dividing `this` by `that`:<br/><br/> `(a/b) / (c/d)` is `(a*d)/(b*c)`
`public Fraction abs()` | Returns a new `Fraction` that is the *absolute value* of `this` fraction.
`public Fraction negate()` | Returns a new `Fraction` that has the same numeric value of `this` fraction, but the opposite sign.
`public Fraction inverse()` | The inverse of `a/b` is `b/a`.
`@Override`<br/>`public boolean equals(Object o)` | Returns `true` if `o` is a `Fraction` equal to `this`, and `false` in all other cases.<br/><br/>You need this method for your `assertEquals(expected, actual)` JUnit tests to work! The `assertEquals` method calls *your* `equals` method to do its testing.
`@Override`<br/>`public int compareTo(Fraction o)` |This method returns:<ul><li>A negative `int` if `this` is less than `o`.</li><li>Zero if `this` is equal to `o`.</li><li>A positive `int` if `this` is greater than `o`.</li></ul>If `o` is `null` this method throws an appropriate (unchecked) exception.
`@Override`<br/>`public String toString()` | Returns a `String` of the form `n/d`, where `n` is the *numerator* and `d` is the *denominator*.<br/>However, if `d` is `1`, just return `n` (as a `String`).<br/> The returned `String` should not contain any blanks.<br/>If the fraction represents a negative number, a minus sign should precede `n`.<br/>This should be one of the first methods you write, because it will help you in debugging.

#### Notes:

* All `Fraction`s should be *immutable*, that is, there should be no way to change their components 
  after the numbers have been created. Most of your methods simply return a new number.
* When you define `equals`, notice that it requires an `Object` as a parameter. 
  This means that the first thing the method should do is make sure that its parameter is in fact 
  a `Fraction`, and return `false` if it is not.
  * You can test with `o instanceof Fraction`.
  * You can use `o` as a `Fraction` by saying `((Fraction)o)`, or you can save it in a `Fraction` 
    variable by saying `Fraction f =(Fraction)o;` and then using `f`.
* You can create additional "helper" methods (for example, to compute the GCD, or to normalise a fraction), 
  if you wish; *we recommend doing so*. 
  If you do, **do not** make these methods `public`, but **do** test them (if you can figure out how).
  
To put a fraction into its lowest terms, divide both the numerator and the denominator by their 
Greatest Common Divisor (GCD); **Euclid's algorithm** finds the GCD of two integers. 
It works as follows: 
* As long as the two numbers are not equal, replace the larger number with the remainder of dividing 
  the larger by the smaller (that is, `larger = larger % smaller`). 
* When the two numbers are equal, that value is the GCD. 

(If this brief explanation isn't enough, look up Euclid's algorithm on the Web.)

## JUnit testing

Your goal in writing the `JUnit` class is to test for *every* possible error. 
This includes making sure that the correct `Exception`s are thrown when appropriate.

Most of your tests will have this form:
```java
@Test
public void testAdd() {
    // Tests that are expected to succeed
}
```
To test for an exception, use this form:
```java
@Test(expected=ArithmeticException.class)
public void testDivideByZero() {
    // test that should throw an ArithmeticException
}
```
You can find the various kinds of assertions you can use in the [JUnit API](http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/).

## Comments

All methods in your `Fraction` class should have `Javadoc` comments. 
The methods in your test class do not need to be commented, unless they are particularly 
complex or non-obvious.

IntelliJ can help you by writing the `Javadoc` "outline" for you, which you can then complete. 
For example, suppose you have written the method stub (you are using TDD, aren't you?):
```java
public Fraction add(Fraction f) {
    return null;
}
```
Then IntelliJ can create:
```java
/**
 * @param f
 * @return
 */ 
```
which you can then complete; for example:
```java
/**
 * Returns the sum of this Fraction and the Fraction f.

 * @param f The Fraction to be added to this one.
 * @return The sum of the two Fractions.
 */
```
### Javadoc

* Create `Javadoc` comments for all your methods (except your test methods). 
  IntelliJ will create the skeleton of a method or class comment for you.
  You have to complete the details, both the general description and after each `@` tag.
* After writing the comments, use IntelliJ to generate the actual `Javadoc` files.
* Finally, look at the `Javadoc` files, and make sure they are complete and correct.

## Grading

Your grade will be based on:
* How correct and complete your number class is.
* How complete and correct your `JUnit` tests are.
* How complete your `Javadoc` is (and whether you remembered to generate it!)
* Your comments and general programming style.

We will use our own programs and our own unit tests for grading purposes, therefore, 
you must adhere to the method names and parameter types shown.
